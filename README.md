# Camping Pack List

This is an app for people who want to go camping but do not want to forget the essentials!
The user gets a list of suggested gear from which they can edit/add/remove according to their own preferences.

# Design

### Colour Palette

I chose a simple colour palette that is easy on the eyes and does not take attention away from the content. Palette chosen with [mycolor](https://mycolor.space/)

Background gradient generated with [cssgradient](https://cssgradient.io/)

### Typography

For headings i used "Fjalla One" and for buttons and text i used "Cantarell" since they make a nice clean font pair. (pairing chosen through [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all))

### Imagery

### Overall feel

I wanted this to be a very simple and easy to understand tool for anyone wanting to check off the essentials before their trip. No instructions needed, just a functioning pack-list with unintrusive colors and images.

## Lighthouse Testing

### Lighthouse

![lighthouse desktop](https://i.ibb.co/JFwQmCt/chrome-n83vb8s-Ify.png)

The accessibility score is low because of the checkbox inputs generated do not have labels, the checkboxes are only used as a visual cue that the item is packed (see image below).
