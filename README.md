# Camping Pack List

This is an app for people who want to go camping but do not want to forget the essentials!
The user can choose what type of camping trip they are going on and get a comprehensive list of suggested gear from which they can edit/add/remove according to their own preferences.

# Design

### Colour Palette

I chose a simple colour palette that is easy on the eyes and does not take attention away from the content.

### Typography

For headinings i used Fjalla One and for buttons and text i used Cantarell since they make a nice clean font pair. (pairing chosen through [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all))

### Overall feel

I wanted this to be a very simple and easy to understand tool for anyone wanting to check of the essentials before their trip. No instructions needed, just a functioning pack-list with unintrusive colors and images.
